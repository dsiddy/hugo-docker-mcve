# `hugo-docker-mcve`

An [MCVE](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to illustrate my own encounter with [`klakegg/docker-hugo#61`](https://github.com/klakegg/docker-hugo/issues/61).

(Thanks, `klakegg`, for your Hugo image, and for helping me to resolve this issue. ðŸ˜Š)

## reproduction steps

1. Run `docker compose up -d` to spin up a Docker container.
2. Open `http://localhost:1313`.
3. Observe the content of `src/content/posts/my-test-post.md`.
4. Change the content of `src/content/posts/my-test-post.md` from the host machine.
5. Observe that the page doesn't auto-reload with the new content, and that a manual refresh also fails to update the content.

Note that changing the content from _within_ the container also fails to trigger a reload. Also, changing `command: server` to `command: server --watch` in `compose.yaml` doesn't help, nor does adding any of the other flags suggested in the issue comments.

## creation steps

Apart from initializing a Git repository and writing `compose.yaml` and this `README`, I followed the [quick start guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/):

1. `hugo new site src`
2. `cd src`
3. `git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke`
4. `echo theme = \"ananke\" >> config.toml` (I did this from within a Kali Linux instance running under WSL 2, because PowerShell's `echo` wrote additional binary content to `config.toml`.)
5. `hugo new posts/my-test-post.md`

I then appended the following to `src/content/posts/my-test-post.md`:

```html
Hello, world!
<!-- 'Til next time, world! -->
```

Finally, I set `draft: false` in the above post's front matter.

## to do

- Package this whole MCVE in its own Docker container. This'll require using Docker wihin Docker, which is [possible](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker) (though I've never tried it).
